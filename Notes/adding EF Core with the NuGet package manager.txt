there are two ways

one using VS:
right click the Project
Manage NuGet Package ...
the packages all have full name "entityFrameworkCore"

the base project o the EntittyFrameworkCore only have the absolute core of the
EF Core. And it doesn't have all the logic you want apply to all scenarios.

EF Core will need to know what database or date store you plan on working with,
those providers are in individual packages. so, you only need to install the one you
want.

but we need some kind of provider to interact with the database

to bring the EF Core along with its provider it is easier to start targeting the provider
you gonna be working with and let NuGet depedencies to pull in the rest include the base
EF Core package.

we will persist our data in SqlServer local DB , which got installed as part of
the VS installation.

Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer

2. Using the Package Manager Console

PM> install-package microsoft.entityframeworkCore.sqlserver
